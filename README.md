## Interests & Skills

- **Artificial Intelligence**: I have attended Machine Learning workshops and have experimented with well-known LLMs such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama. As a result, I have become familiar with prompting that allows for communicating with an LLM effectively. I am interested in learning more about machine learning models, exploring neural networks, and applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems.

- **Gaming**: Perhaps the spark that started my programming journey, I have always been passionate about video games since I played Super Mario Bros. on the SNES. It encouraged me to use languages such as Python to calculate values and call APIs for games such as Runescape. It has also encouraged me to experiment with C# for Unity and JavaScript.

## Goals & Visions

My goal is to continue to grow as a developer, contributing to open-source projects if and when I can, as I try to use my experience and knowledge to solve real-world problems. I am endlessly curious and passionate about what I do, constantly keeping myself humble and ready to learn more.
